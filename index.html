        <h4>Random Paragraph from internet:</h4>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central, unified idea.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">A paragraph should consist of six to seven sentences. No, it should be no longer than three sentences long. Actually, it should include a topic sentence, several supporting sentences, and possibly a concluding sentence.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">A basic paragraph structure usually consists of five sentences: the topic sentence, three supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence. </p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">A good paragraph is composed of a topic sentence (or key sentence), relevant supporting sentences, and a closing (or transition) sentence. This structure is key to keeping your paragraph focused on the main idea and creating a clear and concise image. </p>
